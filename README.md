To get started, get a Python environment running. 

I have Python version 3.6.5

Install flask

`pip install Flask`

Launch:

`FLASK_APP=app.py flask run`


Ideas: 
- take videos, display kaleidoscope
- take videos from cloud sources (google drive, apple icloud)
- add watermarks
- put it on YouTube with API
